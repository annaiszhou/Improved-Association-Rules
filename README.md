# An improved association rules mining algorithm
A breast cancer prediction and diagnosis model was established  based on an improved association rules mining algorithm through the improvement in data structure and operation process of classic APRIORI algorithm. To improve the accuracy and intelligence of the model, alternate circular filtering and double mining of association rules are introduced in the algorithm as well as four major filtering thresholds of association rules, which are dynamic support, dynamic confidence, assistant support and assistant confidence. The research results show that the cancer breast prediction and diagnosis model proposed in this paper has high accuracy on UCI Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. The improved APRIORI algorithm can be used to extract association rules with high confidence while providing relatively accurate disease prediction and diagnosis results, which is an efficient method for predicting benign and malignant breast cancer.
